The flexible TypeScript Markdown editor that works the way **you** want it to.

Inline image previews. ![kitten](https://placekitten.com/2000/200)

Inline code (e.g. `const a = 10`) and code blocks highlighted in real time.

```ts
// Write code with syntax highlighting.
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b
}
```

Stay *focused* on what you write instead of breaking concentration to check formatting.
